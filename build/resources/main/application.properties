#Key Serializer and Value Serializer is to serialize the key and value of the message. If messages
#were send through the Network, the key and value would be serialized to bytes.

#acks=all means that the producer will wait for all in-sync
#replicas to acknowledge the receipt of the message.

# retries=10 number of retries will try sending a message when produce request fails

# backoff.ms=1000 it is the time in milliseconds for the producer
# to wait before attempting another retry
#spring.kafka.producer.properties.retry.backoff.ms=1000

#instead of using retries and backoff.ms, we can use the following properties

#delivery.timeout.ms=120000 this is the maximum time in milliseconds the producer waits
# for acknowledgment from the broker
spring.kafka.producer.properties.delivery.timeout.ms=120000

#delivery.timeout.ms must be greater than the sum of  linger.ms and request.timeout.ms
#linger.ms=0 this is the producer buffer size in milliseconds

# enable.idempotence=true this enables idempotent producer requests
# An idempotent producer request sends the same message multiple times,
# but the producer guarantees that each message will be received exactly once
# to enable idempotent producers you must also set spring.kafka.producer.acks=all and
# spring.kafka.producer.retries greater 0 default value in spring.kafka.producer.retries is
# greater than 0

#max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=5 this is the maximum number of unacknowledged requests
